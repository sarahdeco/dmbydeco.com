                <h2>Save Madagascar:</h2>
                <p>Madagascar grapples with conservation challenges like deforestation, erosion, and soil degradation, which contribute to desertification. These issues are further exacerbated by agricultural fires and contamination of surface water. The island's exceptional biodiversity, with numerous endangered species native only to Madagascar, demands a strong focus on wildlife preservation.
                <p>The importance of practicing ecotourism and sustainable tourism cannot be overstated in light of these challenges. To address these issues, Madagascar actively participates in international agreements concerning environmental protection, reflecting its dedication to global environmental stewardship. 
                <p>Urbanization is on the rise in Madagascar, with an urban population reaching 40.6% in 2023, and the rate of urbanization is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 4.26% between 2020 and 2025. This demographic shift underscores the need for sustainable urban development.
